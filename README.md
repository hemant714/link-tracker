## Database

The application uses in-memory storage for data. Data is stored in memory and will be reset when the server restarts.

### Tables

- **clicks**: Stores click tracking data (IP, user agent, referrer, location, etc.)

## Security Features

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection
- Helmet.js for security headers

## Customization

### Changing the Port

Edit `server.js` and modify the PORT variable:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

### Database Location

The application uses in-memory storage. No database file is created. Data is stored in memory and will be reset when the server restarts.

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Set the port number (default: 3000)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the PORT in server.js or kill the process using the port
2. **Database errors**: Delete the `tracker.db` file and restart the application
3. **CORS issues**: The application includes CORS middleware, but you may need to configure it for your specific domain
